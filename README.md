# Coupled Lateral and Longitudinal MPC for Lateral Stability and Rollover Prevention
This repository contains the code used in the following paper submitted for publication: "COUPLED LATERAL AND LONGITUDINAL CONTROL FOR TRAJECTORY TRACKING, LATERAL STABILITY, AND ROLLOVER PREVENTION USING MINIMUM-TIME PREDICTIVE CONTROLIN AUTOMATED DRIVING". 

Code is organized in the following folders:

**1. Code**

MPC controller, vehicle models, reference trajectory, and other functions. 

**2. plots_5.1_verification**

Code to reproduce plots verifying model accuracy against Carsim for a step input.


## Highlights
- Ready-to-use MATLAB code
- 8-DOF MPC Controller
